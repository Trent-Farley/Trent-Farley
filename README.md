Projects

Pacific Northwest Turtle Tracking App - Western Oregon University partnered with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to create an application for Oregonians to report sightings of endangered turtles.This application is being built in Xamarin Forms and .NET core utilizing the MVC and MVVM frameworks to present and transform this data. During development, I successfully created several pages of the application and the overarching data architecture.

MealFridge - As a senior project, my group built an application that utilizes the MVC .NET core framework and Typescript. This project was centered around getting recipes by what’s in the inventory, searching by recipe name, and generating a meal plan based on personal preferences. During our iterations, the team utilized multiple API’s to retrieve data to reflect onto several pages of the application. Additionally, I led the ScrumMaster during several iterations while solving blockers.

Extracurricular Activities
Event Coordinator- Byte Club (2020-2021) Organized programs and activities for students to participate in.
I coordinated with Western Oregon University and the computer science student body to create events such as hack-a-thons and game nights.
Hack-a-thon Representative- HackOR (2021) Coordinated with fellow representatives to organize and execute a hackathon.
I would love to discuss what a hack-a-thon is in a formal interview.
